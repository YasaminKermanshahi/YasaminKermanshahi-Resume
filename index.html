        I have always been curious about the world around me thatâ€™s what made me interested in science. I became more fascinated in the field of chemistry with every experiment I concurred in the chemistry lab. all those reactions and chemicals made me excited for the outcome as if I have stepped into a magical world. I love chemistry and biology because of the impact both subjects have on our daily lives. I chose the pharmacy as my career since it has elements of both chemistry and biology. I chose the pharmacy as my career since it has both elements of chemistry and biology. 
one of the most interesting factors that made me interested in this career was the convergence of chemistry and math. They both have a significant and direct effect on the lives of the community.<br>
 During my time at the university of California, riverside I have learned valuable skills that will be helpful in assisting me to become a great pharmacist. in chemistry courses that I took in college I became familiar with the illustrated and written aspect of an experiment. This skill will
 help me in the future in better evaluating the result of experiments.<br>
 In order to solve problems in this field I will benefit from my mathematical skill. I will use my logical thinking to analyze the problems. With mathematical skills, I will be able to calculate with greater the dosage of drugs required for the patient with greater accuracy.
Furthered more I have acquired useful skill in computing which will be beneficial in every aspect of my life especially my career. A main skill that I have developed is how to produce and analyze the problems in bigger capacity for research work. This course has given me the skill necessary to tackle complex problems.<br>
Also I have perused voluntary jobs in this field of study. recently I worked as an pharmacy assistant in CVS located in Irvine, California. I have encountered all the works related to becoming a pharmacist and have gained valuable insight of being the community pharmacist.<br>
One of the greatest skills I have developed this year was my communication skill. I did voluntary job for an independent charity organization called working wardrobes. This has given me the opportunity to interact with more people and encounter different situations in which required using my initiative. All this voluntary work made me become a responsible person which is a characteristic required in any field of work especially pharmacist who deal with patientâ€™s lives.<br>
Lastly I have worked with International Student and Scholar organization at UR to give new students an opportunity to engage in full range of international activities. also help them become adjusted in their new environment. This work also helped me to further enhance my communication skill and become familiar with other cultures.<br><br>
